# The Most Common Network Security Threats
  
Companies face a wide range of potential network security threats. The most common network security threats include malware and a range of other cyberattacks.

# Phishing
Phishing is a social engineering attack designed to induce the recipient of a message to take some action. For example, phishing emails are commonly designed to get the recipient to click on a malicious link or open an infected attachment.

Phishing attacks are a leading threat to network security because they provide an effective means for an attacker to gain access to an organization’s network. By trying to trick the user rather than an organization’s security systems, it can offer a lower bar to entry and a higher probability of success than alternative methods of gaining access.
